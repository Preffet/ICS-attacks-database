When Verizon Security Solutions started looking into Kemuri, they immediately noticed that the organization had a poor security architecture, with Internet-facing systems plagued by high-risk vulnerabilities known to be exploited in the wild, and outdated operation technology systems that had been more than 10 years old. Verizon said the attack happened because the company�s IT network was using operating systems that were more than a decade old, and the SCADA platform was powered by an ancient IBM AS/400 system released back in 1988. This IBM server was so outdated only one employee in the entire plant could operate it properly. It connected to both the plant�s IT network (thus the financial records) and OT systems (controlling the water treatment facility and water supply for surrounding areas). The Verizon researchers believed the threat actors were able to get into the plant, and the IBM AS/400 system, via a vulnerability in the payment application web server.

An attack campaign against KNX-based building automation systems,Building Automation,2021 - 2023,High,[x],Various,Unknown,Internet Accessible Device,[x],Unknown,"A German engineering company specialising in electrical and automation services had been contracted to design the building automation system for a mid-sised site. They implemented the system using KNX technology. Later, the customer reported an issue: unauthorised access had been gained to their building automation control system via the internet, resulting in a lockout. The building contained several hundred KNX components, and three-quarters of them were rendered inoperative due to the attack.
This attack was notable for its use of unique, control system-technology specific aspects. The attackers had a deep understanding of KNX technology and knew how to exploit its features. A crucial aspect of the attack involved the bus coupling unit (BCU) key, a protective feature in the KNX standard designed to prevent unauthorised changes to the devices. When a BCU Key is set, all KNX devices in the project that support this feature are locked during the engineering process with an 8-character password. Once activated, devices secured with a BCU key cannot be altered unless the password is known. Most devices do not allow a password reset, even with physical access.
After gaining access, the attackers first disabled the devices and then activated the BCU key on them. This is analogous to purging a computer's hard disk and then setting a password on it. The computer can be powered on, but it becomes useless without its operating system and applications. Without the password, no new operating system or application can be installed. Consequently, hundreds of building automation control devices ceased to function, stripping the building of its automated capabilities.",https://limessecurity.com/en/knxlock/,

Power supply to heating services in Ukraine disrupted by FrostyGoop,Energy,2024,High,[x],Ukraine,Unknown,Exploitation of Remote Services,[x],"The attack has not been attributed to any country or known threat actor, although it involved connections to several Moscow-based IP addresses.","In January 2024, a cyberattack using a newly discovered malware called ""FrostyGoop"" targeted the industrial control systems (ICS) of a municipal energy company in Lviv, Ukraine. This attack disrupted the heating system for 600 apartment buildings, leaving residents without heat for nearly two days during sub-zero temperatures. The attackers gained access by exploiting a vulnerability in a router and used the Modbus communication protocol to send commands that misled the facility's controllers, causing them to falsely report that water was hot when it was actually cold. This resulted in cold water being circulated instead of heated water.",https://www.securityweek.com/frostygoop-ics-malware-left-ukrainian-citys-residents-without-heating/,

Small US wind farm infected with cryptojacking malware,Energy,Unknown,Medium,[x],US,Unknown,Unknown,[x],Unknown,"A small wind farm operator contacted Dragos, a cybersecurity company specialising in industrial control systems (ICS), because they suspected their systems were compromised. The wind farm's network had begun patching itself, an unusual behavior that prompted the company to seek expert help.

When Robert M. Lee, the CEO and founder of Dragos, investigated the incident, he discovered that the systems were compromised with crypto-jacking malware, which was using the turbines' computing power to mine Bitcoin. Surprisingly, the attackers were regularly patching the systems to keep other malware out. Despite the risks, and against the advice from Dragos, the wind farm's management decided to leave the malware in place because the attackers' maintenance was more effective than their own IT department's efforts. This decision was driven by the company's limited resources and the lack of impact on their operations.",https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/22/,
Sandworm attack on the Courlandon French mill ,Food,2024,Medium,[x],France,APT,Unknown,[x],Sandworm,"A recent report by Mandiant revealed that the Russian hacker group Sandworm mistakenly targeted a small mill in France, believing it to be a significant hydroelectric dam. This error was part of a broader campaign of cyber sabotage. The mill, located in a village of 300 people, experienced a minor adjustment in water levels controlled remotely by the hackers. Despite their intentions, the mill's physical defenses prevented any significant damage.

Sandworm's target was supposed to be the Courlon-sur-Yonne dam, a critical node in France�s hydroelectric infrastructure. Instead, they hit a small mill in Courlandon used for minor electric production. The confusion likely resulted from misinterpreting geographic data and relying on online platforms like Yandex for reconnaissance. The intended target plays a crucial role in the regional power grid, where disruptions could have caused substantial electricity supply issues.",https://www.defensorum.com/misguided-cyber-operation-french-mill-incident/,https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2024/04/17/how-sandworm-russia-s-elite-hackers-attacked-a-small-mill-instead-of-dam-they-targetted_6668731_13.html
Interference with rail control systems stops Polish trains,Transport,2023,Low,[x],Poland,Hacktivists,Wireless Compromise,[x],"Apparent supporters of Russia, two men, aged 24 and 29 are suspected","On August 25 and 26, more than 20 trains in Poland were brought to a halt by apparent supporters of Russia using a simple �radio-stop� command. This sabotage involved broadcasting a series of three acoustic tones at a 150.100 megahertz frequency, which triggered the emergency stop function of the trains. The saboteurs included the Russian national anthem and parts of a speech by President Vladimir Putin in their broadcasts. Polish media and the BBC described the incidents as a �cyberattack,� though it did not involve any sophisticated cyber techniques. The attack exploited the lack of encryption or authentication in Poland's railway radio system, which will not be upgraded until 2025.
